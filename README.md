Updated for python3.9

Tool is rewrote for a better experience

## About
This is Python3.9 script that is in charge of searching all type of backdoors in the directory that you indicate (by default it will be /var/www/), I have not been able to dedicate all the time that I would like, but I think it works quite well and it is very simple to add more search values.

Use sudo, if you are going to scan directories that do not belong to the user running it.
